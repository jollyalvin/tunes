# Tunes

It's a simple music player where you can add your music from storage and play them. It also contains a analyzer that analyzes the current song.<br>
This app uses [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) for playing song and analyzing the frequency of songs.
